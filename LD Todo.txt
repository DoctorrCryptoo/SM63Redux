TODO:
- Rewrite and formalize comments in ld_main.gd.

TOFIX:
- OUTLINE: First Shine Sprite icon in pause menu is invisible due to shader
	- Update: this is due to the sprite having "Centered" unchecked.
	  If I uncheck it and recreate the same displacement with sprite offset,
	  I at least get a couple stray pixels.
- OUTLINE: Sprite offset squishes/expands texture as it goes down/up,
	proportional to outline width. (An offset of 0,0 looks normal.)
- OUTLINE: Sprite offset slightly shifts texture along offset direction,
	also proportional to outline width. When Y offset = -1.5, each outline
	step moves the sprite 1/16 a pixel upwards.
- OUTLINE: Multi-select looks wrong for items that use different sprite sheets.

WONTFIX:
- Test serializing Vector2 (1, 1) fails (result: (0, 0)).

FIXED:
- In-level display icons' glow cuts off at the edges.
- Some in-level display icons move off-center when selected.
- RMB on LD item causes instant crash.
- OUTLINE: When the outline is wide enough, bits of neighboring frames
	will show up on the edges of the bounding box.

FOR FUTURE:
- Don't let nulti-select area appear until a drag event occurs. Not only is it annoying to see the blue blip anytime I click, but if I place a goomba and koopa right next to each other, it's hard to select only one because the select box immediately picks both. (Depending which one I pick, that is.)
- big_rock.gd can be repurposed for all mirrorable, disable-able solid objects.
- log.gd likewise for objects which can't be mirrored, but can be disabled.
