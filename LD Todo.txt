TODO:
- Rewrite and formalize comments in ld_main.gd.

TOFIX:
- Test serializing Vector2 (1, 1) fails (result: (0, 0)).
- RMB on LD item causes instant crash.

FIXED:
- In-level display icons' glow cuts off at the edges.
- Some in-level display icons move off-center when selected.

FOR FUTURE:
- Don't let nulti-select area appear until a drag event occurs. Not only is it annoying to see the blue blip anytime I click, but if I place a goomba and koopa right next to each other, it's hard to select only one because the select box immediately picks both. (Depending which one I pick, that is.)
